## Description
The  purpose of the project was to build an application in Javascript that could allow users to create README.md files from the terminal. The user would be given a series of prompts to help guide them through the process of creating a high quality README file. A big part of the motivatin to create this application was to provide a convenient way for users to create README files. Another motivation was to better familiarize myself with inquirer npm and caputuring user input in Node.js. From this experience I was able to learn how to create prompts using inquirer npm. From this project, I also learned more about open source licensing and the importance of open source software.

## Installation
To properly run this application, clone a copy of the repository from GitHub. Next, install inquirer by typing "npm install inqurier@8.2.4". In the terminal, navigate to the directory where the index.js file is located. In the terminal, type "node index.js". The README generator prompt should begin by asking the user for the project title. Answer all the questions in the prompt and a README file should be generated with all  the user's input.
